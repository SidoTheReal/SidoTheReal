I am a Cyber Security & Privacy Bachelor student in my 5th semester at Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg.  
My interests focus on network security, cryptography, digital forensics and modern security technologies.

As part of my studies and practical work, I enjoy analyzing networks, identifying vulnerabilities,  
and understanding how secure systems are built  and broken.



## Objective
I am a 5th semester B.Sc. Cyber Security & Privacy student at Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg, building solid foundations in network security, digital forensics, incident response, and secure system design.

My current goal is to gain **practical experience in the cybersecurity field** and apply my academic knowledge in real-world environments. I am particularly interested in:

- Security Operations (SOC)  
- Blue Team Monitoring  
- Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)  
- Network Security and Log Analysis  

I aim to develop my technical skills further and contribute to security-focused teams through hands-on work and continuous learning.
